## 🔍 Platform Philosophy

### 🧠 Neuroinclusive by Design
All of our tools are built with accessibility, low cognitive load, and consistency at the forefront — guided by the principles of universal design.

### 🤖 Ethical AI-First Architecture
We use LLMs and AI agents only when they reinforce equity, transparency, and user agency. We prioritize explainability, consent, and auditability.

### 💡 Modular MVP Development
Our products are built in modular vertical slices and released as fast, iterative MVPs — with feedback from neurodivergent testers and advocates.
